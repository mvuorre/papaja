  abstract = {In their paper Why optional stopping is a problem for Bayesians, @deHeide:Grunwald:2020 critique the claim that those using Bayes factor can sample until there is sufficient evidence to support one or another model.  de Heide and Grünwald's main message is that unless you believe your priors to govern the data-generating mechanism, optional stopping may distort inference.  We show here that the distortions are not in inference but in interpretation. Their claim is about what happens when the analyst's models do not match the data generating models, that is, the Bayes factor for models not specified. Given that we never know the underlying data generation mechanism we ask researcher to interpret Bayes factors for what they are---the relative strength of evidence from data for two hypotheticals.   We discuss how researchers should assess the robustness of their results by considering reasonable variation in model specification conditional on observed data rather than on hypothetical truths.},

  abstract = {It is commonplace, when discussing the subject of psychological theory, to write articles from the assumption that psychology differs from physical sciences in that we have no theories that would support cumulative, incremental science. In this brief paper I discuss one counterexample, namely Shepard's (1987) law of generalization and the various Bayesian extensions that it inspired over the last three decades. Using Shepard's law as a running example I argue that psychological theory building is not a statistical problem; mathematical formalism is theoretically beneficial; measurement and theory have a complex relationship; rewriting old theory can yield new insights; and finally, that theoretical growth can drive empirical work. Though generally suggesting that the tools of mathematical psychology are valuable to the psychological theorist, the paper also comments on some limitations to this approach.},

  abstract = {Objective: Daily and non-daily smokers display fundamentally different smoking habits and motives. However, both smoking groups find it difficult to quit smoking long-term. One factor associated with addictive behaviour is attentional bias, but previous research in daily and non-daily smokers found inconsistent results. Method: Using an online sample, we compared daily (n = 106) and non-daily (n = 60) smokers in their attentional bias towards smoking pictures. Participants completed a visual probe task with two picture presentation times: 200ms and 500ms. Results: We expected non-daily smokers to display greater attentional bias than daily smokers, but the results did not support this. In confirmatory analyses, there were no significant effects of interest, and in exploratory analyses, equivalence testing showed the effects were statistically equivalent to zero. Conclusions: The results can be interpreted in line with contemporary theories of attentional bias where there are unlikely to be stable trait-level differences between smoking groups. Future research in attentional bias should focus on state-level differences to focus on how smoking cues are being evaluated in the moment.},

One paradigm supporting the possibility of unconscious attitude learning is the surveillance paradigm (Olson \&amp; Fazio, 2001), which relies on incidental learning conditions. In a recent pre-registered replication report, Moran (2020) claimed that they obtained evidence for attitude learning in this paradigm that was not moderated by the level of awareness of the participants. Here, we explain that this claim is unwarranted and report meta-analytic results supporting our conclusion. Specifically, we distinguish between independent sets of fully aware, partially aware, and fully aware participants. We show that evaluative learning effects are moderated by participants’ set and are found in the latter two sets only. We discuss this finding in the broader perspective of associative attitude learning models.  Manuscript and code are available at https://osf.io/qs35v.},

Students' minds often wander, yet we know little about how mind wandering affects attention during video lectures. This paper presents two studies that examined eye movement patterns of mind wandering during video lectures. In the studies, mind wandering reports were collected by either self-caught reports or thought probes. Results were similar across the studies: mind wandering was associated with an increased allocation of fixations to the instructor's image. For fixations on the slides, the average duration increased but the dispersion decreased. Moreover, preliminary evidence suggested that fixation duration and dispersion can diminish soon after self-caught reports of mind wandering. Overall, these findings help advance our understanding of how learners' attention is affected during mind wandering and may facilitate efforts in objectively identifying mind wandering. Future research is needed to determine if these findings can extend to other instructional formats.},

However, the effect is rather small in a sentence-picture verification task compared to published effects of other visual dimensions, such as shape, size, and color. The present study examines whether object size moderates the orientation effect. Theoretical considerations of how we interact with manipulable versus non-manipulable objects lead us to predict a smaller effect for manipulable objects than for non-manipulable objects. We furthermore predict the generalization of this pattern across languages (Chinese, Dutch, and English). Furthermore, we seek converging evidence in a picture-picture verification task that compares the verification times between pairs of rotated or non-rotated objects.  Longer verification times for large objects would indicate that these objects require more cognitive effort for mental simulation than small objects, regardless of the presence of language.},

Yet, their functional mechanisms are poorly understood because their structures are difficult to determine experimentally. As a result, developing more effective computational techniques to predict RNA structures becomes increasingly an urgent task. One key challenge in RNA structure prediction is the lack of an accurate free energy function to guide RNA folding and discriminate native and near-native structures from decoy conformations. In this study, we developed an all-atom distance-dependent knowledge-based energy function for RNA that is based on a reference state (distance-scaled finite ideal-gas reference state, DFIRE) proven successful for protein structure discrimination. Using four separate benchmarks including RNA puzzles, we found that this DFIRE-based RNA statistical energy function is able to discriminate native and near-native structures against decoys with performance comparable with or better than several existing scoring functions compared. The energy function is expected to be useful for improving the detection of RNA near-native structures.},

  abstract = {Mind-wandering (i.e., thoughts irrelevant to the current task) occurs frequently during reading. The current study examined whether mind-wandering was associated with reduced rereading when the reader read the so-called garden-path jokes. In a garden-path joke, the reader’s initial interpretation is violated by the final punchline, and the violation creates a semantic incongruity that needs to be resolved (e.g., 'My girlfriend has read so many negative things about smoking. Therefore, she decided to quit reading.'). Rereading text prior to the punchline can help resolve the incongruity. In a main study and a preregistered replication, participants read jokes and nonfunny controls embedded in filler texts and responded to thought probes that assessed intentional and unintentional mind-wandering. Results were consistent across the two studies: When the reader was not mind-wandering, jokes elicited more rereading (from the punchline) than the nonfunny controls did, and had a recall advantage over the nonfunny controls. During mind-wandering, however, the additional eye movement processing and the recall advantage of jokes were generally reduced. These results show that mind-wandering is associated with reduced rereading, which is important for resolving higher level comprehension difficulties.

  url = {https://osf.io/tmxkw},
  doi = {10/gf6jwz},
  abstract = {Mnemonic discrimination is the ability to discriminate among similar memories. Discrimination failures can result in a wide range of phenomena, from minor confusions to high-confidence, vividly experienced false memories. Separable encoding of similar information is necessary for successful discrimination, and the neurocomputational process that assumedly decorrelates neural representations during encoding and consolidation is refered to as pattern separation. Deficits in pattern separation have been found to contribute to age-related declines in mnemonic functioning, and this finding has motivated several intervention studies. We followed-up a recent report that one 200 mg-dose of caffeine administered post-study enhances consolidation assessed by mnemonic discrimination after 24 hours (Borota et al., 2014). To address concerns that the reported enhancements are an artifact of performance-impairing withdrawal symptoms in the control group, we did not restrict preexperimental caffeine consumption and statistically adjusted treatment effects for habitual caffeine consumption. We did not detect any effects of caffeine on mnemonic discrimination. Nonsuperiority testing ruled out medium and large enhancements in both average (1200 mg per week) and low-consumers (50 mg per week). Our results raise doubts about an enhancing effect of caffeine on mnemonic discrimination on two counts: If the effect exists, it (1) is substantially smaller than originally reported and (2) may reflect an offset of performance-impairing withdrawal symptoms rather than genuinely enhanced consolidation. We conclude that it currently seems unlikely that 200 mg caffeine administered post-study enhances memory consolidation and subsequent mnemonic discrimination.},

  abstract = {Evaluative conditioning (EC) describes a change in preference towards a formerly neutral stimulus (Conditioned Stimulus; CS) after this stimulus is paired with a valent stimulus (Unconditioned Stimulus; US), in the direction of the valence of the US. Evaluative conditioning is proposed as a mechanism of automatic preference acquisition in dual-process theories of attitudes (Gawronski \& Bodenhausen, 2006). An automatic route to preference acquisition entails that people do not need to be aware of the CS-US contingency in order for EC effects to develop. To experimentally investigate whether EC effects persist without peoples’ awareness, stimuli (e.g., the CS) are presented subliminally (i.e., too briefly to be consciously perceived). When the CS is presented subliminally, contingency awareness between CS and US can be ruled out. Hence, EC effects with subliminal CSs would support theories claiming that contingency awareness is not necessary for EC effects to occur. Studies demonstrating an EC effect with subliminally presented stimuli are reviewed and the stability of the described subliminal EC effect is evaluated. A series of replication studies and additional experiments were conducted to investigate possible boundary conditions for EC effects to occur with subliminally presented stimuli. Specifically, it was tested whether the following features would be beneficial for EC effects with subliminally presented stimuli: (I) goal-relevance during the learning procedure and a relation between CS and US (II) subliminal US presentation with additional counter-attitudinal information (III) choice between CSs after the learning phase as a potentially more sensitive measure of conditioning effects and (IV) a simultaneous presentation of CS and US. Across the experiments, indications for the absence of EC effects with subliminal stimuli were discovered. Additional findings hint to the possibility that subliminal EC effects that were previously found, might have been based on briefly presented—but visible—stimulus presentations. The findings lead to the conclusion that EC does not form automatically. Theoretical implications about the nature of EC are discussed.},

What drives children's looking towards the mouth versus eyes of a talking face? This study reports data from 292 children who viewed faces speaking English, French, and Russian. We investigated the impact of children’s age (5 months to 5 years) and language background (monolingual English, monolingual French, bilingual English-French), and the speaker’s language (dominant, non-dominant, or non-native) relative to children’s native language(s). Data from 129 bilingual adults were also collected for comparison. Five-month-olds showed balanced attention to the eyes and mouth, but children up to 5 years tended to be most interested in the mouth. In contrast, adults were most interested in the eyes. We found little evidence for different patterns of attention for monolinguals versus bilinguals, or to a native versus a non-native speaker. Using percentile scores, monolinguals with larger productive vocabularies looked more at the mouth, while bilinguals with larger comprehension vocabularies looked marginally less at the mouth, although both effects were small and not as robust with raw vocabulary scores. Children showed large but stable individual variability in their face scanning patterns across different speakers. Our results show that the way that children allocate their attention to talking faces continues to change from infancy through the preschool years and beyond. Future studies will need to go beyond looking at bilingualism, speaker language, and vocabulary size to understand what drives children’s in-the-moment attention to talking faces.},

Part of this challenge in today's landscape is using new technologies such as cloud storage and computer automation.  Here we discuss a few practices designed to increase the reliability of scientific labs by focusing on what technologies and elements minimize common, ordinary mistakes.  We borrow principles from the Theory of High-Reliability Organizations which has been used to characterize operational practices in high-risk environments such as aviation and healthcare.  From these principles, we focus on five elements: 1. implementing a lab culture focused on learning from mistakes; 2. using computer automation in data and meta-data collection wherever possible; 3. standardizing organization strategies; 4. using coded rather than menu-driven analyses; 5. developing expanded documents that record how analyses were performed.},

  abstract = {A prevailing notion in experimental psychology is that individuals' performance in a task varies gradually in a continuous fashion. In a Stroop task, for example, the true average effect may be 50ms with a standard deviation of say 30ms. In this case, some individuals will have greater effects than 50ms, some will have smaller, and some are fore-casted to have negative effects in sign - they respond faster to incongruent items than to congruent ones!  But are there people who have a true negative effect in Stroop or any other task?  We highlight three *qualitatively different* effects: negative effects, null effects, and positive effects.  The main goal of this paper is to develop models that allow researchers to explore whether all three are present in a task: Do all individuals show a positive effect? Are there individuals with truly no effect?  Are there any individuals with negative effects?  We develop a family of Bayesian hierarchical models that capture a variety of these constraints. We apply this approach to Stroop interference experiments and a near-liminal priming experiment where the prime may be below and above threshold for different people.  We show that most tasks people are quite alike - for example everyone has positive Stroop effects and nobody fails to Stroop or Stroops negatively.  We also show a case that under very specific circumstances,  we could entice some people to not Stroop at all.},

One way of gaining additional specificity is to posit multiple ordinal constraints simultaneously. For example a theory might predict an effect in one condition, a larger effect in another, and none in a third. We call such simultaneous constraints a ‘system of orders’ and show how common theoretical positions lead naturally to system-of-order predictions. We adopt a Bayesian model comparison approach to assess evidence for multiple, simultaneous order constraints, a difficult endeavor in a frequentist framework. The result is a statistical system custom tuned for the way social scientists conceptualize theory that is more intuitive and informative than current linear-model approaches.},

We argue that the fundamental questions of meta-analysis should not be about the aggregated mean; instead, one should ask which relations are stable across all the studies.  In a typical meta-analysis, there is a preferred or hypothesized direction (e.g., that violent video games increase, rather than decrease, agressive behavior).  We ask whether all studies in a meta-analysis have true effects in a common direction. If so, this is an example of a stable relation across all the studies.  We propose four models: (i) all studies are truly null; (ii) all studies share a single true nonzero effect; (iii) studies differ, but all true effects are in the same direction; and (iv) some study effects are truly positive while others are truly negative.  We develop Bayes factor model comparison for these models and apply them to four extant meta-analyses to show their usefulness.},

Adapted CBT for OCD in adults with ASD has not previously been evaluated outside the United Kingdom. In this study, 19 adults with OCD and Asperger syndrome were treated using an updated CBT protocol. The primary outcome was the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). Secondary outcomes were self-rated obsessive-compulsive symptoms, depressive symptoms, quality of life, and daily functioning. Participants were assessed at baseline, at 10 weeks during treatment, at post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up. Treatment response and remission were determined according to international consensus definitions. There were large reductions on the YBOCS at post-treatment, and improvements were sustained at follow-up (d=1.2). Self-rated OCD symptoms and depressive symptoms also showed statistically significant reductions. Improvements in general functioning and quality of life were non-significant. At follow-up, three participants were responders and one was in full remission. Adapted CBT for OCD in adults with co-occuring ASD is associated with significant reductions in obsessive-compulsive symptoms and depressive symptoms. However, outcomes were modest; few patients were completely symptom free, and general functioning and quality of life did not improve significantly. We identify and discuss the need for further treatment refinement for this vulnerable patient group.},

  url = {https://osf.io/f3h2k},
  doi = {10/gfdbw2},
  abstract = {In modern individual-difference studies, researchers often correlate performance on various tasks to uncover common latent processes.  Yet, in some sense, the results have been disappointing as correlations among tasks that seemingly have processes in common are often low.   A pressing question then is whether these attenuated correlations reflect statistical considerations, such as a lack of individual variability on tasks, or substantive considerations, such as that inhibition in different tasks is not a unified concept.  One problem in addressing this question is that researchers aggregate performance across trials to tally individual-by-task scores, and the covariation of these scores is subsequently studied much as it would be with classical test theory.  It is tempting to think that aggregation here is fine and everything comes out in the wash, but as shown here, it greately attenuates measures of effect size and correlation.  We propose an alternative psychometrics of task performance that is based on accounting for trial-by-trial variability along with the covariation of individuals' performance across tasks.  The implementation is through common hierarchical models, and this treatment rescues classical concepts of effect size, reliability, and correlation for studying individual differences with experimental tasks.  Using recent data from Hedge et al. (2018) we show  that there is Bayes-factor support for a lack of correlation between the Stroop and flanker task.  This support for a lack of correlation indicates a psychologically relevant result---Stroop and flanker inhibition are seemingly unrelated, contradicting unified concepts of inhibition.},

  doi = {10/gdz63r},
  abstract = {In 3 experiments, we examined fluctuations in working memory (WM) performance and associated changes in pretrial and task-evoked pupil diameter. Additionally, we examined whether behavioral lapses were accompanied by self-reports of off-task attentional states. The results demonstrated that task-evoked pupillary responses can be used to measure moment-to-moment fluctuations in the success of WM maintenance during delay intervals. Further, when individuals reported being in an off-task attentional state, their WM performance suffered. Additionally, when probed directly after a particularly poor trial, participants reported being in an off-task attentional state more often than at random intervals throughout the task. So behavioral, subjective, and physiological data converged when people experienced WM failures. Although pretrial pupil diameter did not consistently differentiate between successful and unsuccessful trials, variability in pretrial pupil diameter accounted for a significant portion of variance in WM task performance. This effect persisted after controlling for mean task-evoked pupillary response and variability in task-evoked pupillary responses. Thus, one of the major reasons people varied in the consistency with which they utilized their WM system was variability in arousal. Such variability in arousal is potentially due to variation in the functioning of the LC-NE neuromodulatory system, and thus may underlie individual differences in WM capacity and attention control.},

  abstract = {Access to data is a critical feature of an efficient, progressive and ultimately self-correcting scientific ecosystem. But the extent to which in-principle benefits of data sharing are realized in practice is unclear. Crucially, it is largely unknown whether published findings can be reproduced by repeating reported analyses upon shared data (‘analytic reproducibility’). To investigate this, we conducted an observational evaluation of a mandatory open data policy introduced at the journal Cognition. Interrupted time-series analyses indicated a substantial post-policy increase in data available statements (104/417, 25\% pre-policy to 136/174, 78\% post-policy), although not all data appeared reusable (23/104, 22\% pre-policy to 85/136, 62\%, post-policy). For 35 of the articles determined to have reusable data, we attempted to reproduce 1324 target values. Ultimately, 64 values could not be reproduced within a 10\% margin of error. For 22 articles all target values were reproduced, but 11 of these required author assistance. For 13 articles at least one value could not be reproduced despite author assistance. Importantly, there were no clear indications that original conclusions were seriously impacted. Mandatory open data policies can increase the frequency and quality of data sharing. However, suboptimal data curation, unclear analysis specification and reporting errors can impede analytic reproducibility, undermining the utility of data sharing and the credibility of scientific findings.},

Second, this study will further explore the nature of the structure of memory, by investigating the effects of single concept information (i.e., word frequency, concreteness, etc.) on relatedness judgments and recall accuracy. We hypothesize that associative, semantic, and thematic memory networks are interactive in their relationship to judgments and recall, even after controlling for base rates of single concept information, implying a set of interdependent memory systems used for both cognitive processes.},

  abstract = {Background: Ongoing, pre-stimulus oscillatory activity in the 8-13 Hz alpha range has been shown to correlate with both true and false reports of peri-threshold somatosensory stimuli. However, to directly test the role of such oscillatory activity in behaviour, it is necessary to manipulate it. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) offers a method of directly manipulating oscillatory brain activity using a sinusoidal current passed to the scalp.
Objective: We tested whether alpha tACS would change somatosensory sensitivity or response bias in a signal detection task in order to test whether alpha oscillations have a causal role in behaviour.
Methods: Active 10 Hz tACS or sham stimulation was applied using electrodes placed bilaterally at positions CP3 and CP4 of the 10-20 electrode placement system. Participants performed the Somatic Signal Detection Task (SSDT), in which they must detect brief somatosensory targets delivered at their detection threshold. These targets are sometimes accompanied by a light flash, which could also occur alone. 
Results: Active tACS did not modulate sensitivity to targets but did modulate response criterion. Specifically, we found that  active stimulation generally increased touch reporting rates, but particularly increased responding on light trials. Stimulation did not interact with the presence of touch, and thus increased both hits and false alarms. 
Conclusions: tACS stimulation increased reports of touch in a manner consistent with our observational reports, changing response bias, and consistent with a role for alpha activity in somatosensory detection.},

Participants showed N400 reduction for related word pairs, both semantic and associative, in comparison to unrelated word pairs for the lexical decision task, indicating automatic access for both types of relatedness. For a letter search task, the N400 showed differences between nonwords and other stimuli but no attenuation for related pairs. Response latency data indicated associative priming in both tasks with semantic priming also found in the letter search task. These results help discern possible automatic and controlled processes occurring during these tasks, as the N400 may show automatic processing during the lexical decision task, while the response latency data may provide evidence for controlled processing during the letter search task.},

This article presents the Linguistic Annotated Bibliography (LAB) as a searchable web portal to quickly and easily access reliable database norms, related programs, and variable calculations. These publications (*N* = 706) were coded by language, number of stimuli, stimuli type (i.e., words, pictures, symbols), keywords (i.e., frequency, semantics, valence), and other useful information. This tool not only allows researchers to search for the specific type of stimuli needed for experiments, but also permits the exploration of publication trends across 100 years of research. Details about the portal creation and use are outlined, as well as various analyses of change in publication rates and keywords. In general, advances in computation power have allowed for the increase in dataset size in the recent decades, in addition to an increase in the number of linguistic variables provided in each publication.},

  abstract = {In the field of evaluative conditioning (EC), two opposing theories—propositional single-process theory versus dual-process theory—are currently being discussed in the literature. The present set of experiments test a crucial prediction to adjudicate between these two theories: Dual-process theory postulates that evaluative conditioning can occur without awareness of the contingency between conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US); in contrast, single-process propositional theory postulates that EC requires CS-US contingency awareness. In a set of three studies, we experimentally manipulate contingency awareness by presenting the CSs very briefly, thereby rendering it unlikely to be processed consciously. We address potential issues with previous studies on EC with subliminal or near-threshold CSs that limited their interpretation. Across two experiments, we consistently found an EC effect for CSs presented for 1000 ms and consistently failed to find an EC effect for briefly presented CSs. In a third pre-registered experiment, we again found evidence for an EC effect with CSs presented for 1000 ms, and we found some indication for an EC effect for CSs presented for 20 ms.},

  abstract = {Previous research has claimed that evaluative conditioning (EC) effects may obtain in the absence of perceptual identification of conditioned stimuli (CSs). A recent meta-analysis suggested similar effect sizes for supra- and subliminal CSs, but this was based on a small body of evidence (k = 8 studies; Hofmann, De Houwer, Perugini, Baeyens, \& Crombez, 2010). We critically discuss this prior evidence, and then report and discuss 6 experimental studies that investigate EC effects for briefly presented CSs using more stringent methods. Across these studies, we varied CS duration, the presence or absence of masking, the presence or absence of a CS identification check, CS material, and the instructions communicated to participants. EC effects for longer-duration CSs were modulated by attention to the CS–US pairing. Across studies, we were consistently unable to obtain EC for briefly presented CSs. In most studies, this pattern was observed despite above-chance perceptual identification of the CSs. A meta-analysis conducted across the 27 experimental conditions supported the null hypothesis of no EC for perceptually unidentified CSs. We conclude that EC effects for briefly presented and masked CSs are either not robust, are very small, or are limited to specific conditions that remain to be identified (or any combination of these).

We explain how to statistically evaluate null-results using equiv- alence tests, Bayesian estimation, and Bayes factors. A worked example demonstrates how to apply these statistical tools, and interpret the results. Finally, we explain how no statistical approach can actually prove that the null-hypothesis is true, and briefly discuss the philosophical differences be- tween statistical approaches to examine null-effects. The increasing avail- ability of software and online tools to perform equivalence tests, Bayesian estimation, and Bayes factors make it timely and feasible to move beyond traditional null-hypothesis tests, and allow researchers to draw more infor- mative conclusions about null-effects.},

One hundred and twelve participants were recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. They were shown word pairs of varying relatedness and were then asked to judge these word pairs for their semantic, thematic, and associative strength. After completing a distractor task, participants then completed a cued recall task. The data was then analyzed through multilevel modeling, incorporating a logistic regression to account for the binary nature of the recall.  Four hypotheses were tested. First, we sought to expand previous work on memory judgments to include three types of judgments of memory, while also replicating bias and sensitivity findings. Next, we tested for an interaction between the three database norms (FSG, COS, and LSA) when predicting participant judgments. Third, we extended this analysis to test for interactions between the three database norms when predicting recall. In both our second and third hypothesis, significant three-way interactions were found between FSG, COS, and LSA when predicting judgments or recall. For low semantic feature overlap, thematic and associative strength were competitive; as thematic strength increased, associative predictiveness decreased. However, this trend reversed for high semantic feature overlap, wherein thematic and associative strength were complimentary as both set of simple slopes increased together. Finally, we showed that judgment-database slopes were predictive of recall.},

  doi = {10.17605/osf.io/7h24p},
  abstract = {The psychological literature is regularly criticised on the basis that limited sampling quality might restrict the inferences that can be made. Specifically, researchers have raised concerns regarding over-reliance upon samples from Western Educated Industrialised Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) societies, and in particular from university students. In addition, a growing tendency to collect data using anonymous and unsupervised online surveys might introduce problems of data quality. Studies from evolutionary psychology often seek to uncover aspects of evolved universal characteristics, and so criticisms of sample diversity would be a particular problem for the field. Here, we empirically examine the samples used in the 2015 volumes of ‘Evolution \& Human Behavior’ (57 articles) and ‘Evolutionary Psychology’ (43 articles). Our database consists of 166 samples of humans (median sample size= 206). The majority of samples were either online or student samples (60\% of samples), followed by other adult Western samples (19\%). 129 of the samples were classified as ‘Western’ (78\%, Europe/North America/Australia). The remaining samples were predominantly from Asia (N= 26; 16\%, mostly Japan). Only a small fraction of the samples was classified as cross-cultural (5), South American (3) or African (2). The median sample size did not significantly differ between continents, but online samples (both paid and unpaid) were typically larger than samples sourced offline. While it seems that the samples used are more diverse than those that have been reported in reviews of the literature from social and developmental psychology, it also apparent that the majority of samples remain WEIRD. We discuss the implications for Evolutionary Psychology as a discipline.},

  abstract = {The minimum covariance determinant (MCD) algorithm is one of the most common techniques to detect anomalous or outlying observations. The MCD algorithm depends on two features of multivariate data: the determinant of a matrix (i.e., geometric mean of the eigenvalues) and Mahalanobis distances (MD). While the MCD algorithm is commonly used, and has many extensions, the MCD is limited to analyses of quantitative data and more specifically data assumed to be continuous. One reason why the MCD does not extend to other data types such as categorical or ordinal data is because there is not a well-defined MD for data types other than continuous data. To address the lack of MCD-like techniques for categorical or mixed data we present a generalization of the MCD. To do so, we rely on a multivariate technique called correspondence analysis (CA). Through CA we can define MD via singular vectors and we can compute the determinant from CA's eigenvalues. Here we define and illustrate a generalized MCD on categorical data and then show how our generalized MCD extends beyond categorical data to accommodate mixed data types (e.g., categorical, ordinal, and continuous). We illustrate this generalized MCD on data from two large scale projects: the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with data such as genetics (categorical), clinical instruments and surveys (categorical or ordinal), and neuroimaging (continuous) data. We also make R code and toy data available in order to illustrate our generalized MCD.},

Similar lures were judged old more often than unrelated items, and confidence for false alarms was greater for similar lures than for unrelated items. This perceptual false memory effect was not modulated by rotation of stimuli between study and test, was unaffected by retention interval (0 vs. 20 min), and was obtained regardless of response format (old/new and old/similar/new).

Results replicated the finding of a simultaneous EC effect in the absence of unconditioned stimulus (US) identity memory; in contrast, sequential EC effects depended on the presence of US identity memory. Yet, both EC effects were larger in the presence than in the absence of US identity memory and depended on the presence of US valence memory.

These scales have questions about suicidality, depression, and life goals that may cause item reactivity (i.e. a changed response to a second item based on the answer to the first item).

  abstract = {Recent advances in the field of computational linguistics have led to the development of various prediction-based models of semantics. These models seek to infer word representations from large text collections by predicting target words from neighboring words (or vice versa). The resulting representations are vectors in a continuous space, collectively called word embeddings. Although psychological plausibility was not a primary concern for the developers of predictive models, it has been the topic of several recent studies in the field of psycholinguistics. That is, word embeddings have been linked to similarity ratings, word associations, semantic priming, word recognition latencies, etcetera. Here, we build on this work by investigating category structure. More specifically, we first obtained a prototype for a number of common categories (e.g., birds, fruit, vehicles,...) either  by averaging across exemplar vectors (e.g., robin, dove, sparrow,...) or by relying on the representation of the label itself (e.g., bird). Then, we correlated the cosine similarity between an exemplar and its prototype with human typicality judgments. The resulting correlations turned out to be disappointingly low, especially given the enthusiasm surrounding predictive models.},

  abstract = {As effect sizes gain ground as important indicators of practical significance and as a meta-analytic tool, we must critically understand their limitations and biases. This project expands on research by @Okada2013, which highlighted the positive bias of eta squared and suggested the use of omega squared or epsilon for their lack of bias. These variance overlap measures were examined for potential bias in different data scenarios (i.e. truncated and Likert type data) to elucidate differences in bias from previous research. We found that data precision and truncation affected effect size bias, often lowering the bias in eta squared. This work expands our understanding of bias on variance overlap measures and allows researchers to make an informed choice about the type of effect to report given their research study. Implications for sample size planning and power are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing is frequently cited as a threat to the validity and reproducibility of the social sciences. While many individuals suggest we should focus on altering the *p*-value at which we deem an effect significant, we believe this suggestion is short-sighted. Alternative procedures (i.e., Bayesian analyses and Observation Oriented Modeling) can be more powerful and meaningful to our discipline. However, these methodologies are less frequently utilized and are rarely discussed in combination with NHST. Herein, we compare the possible interpretations of three analyses (ANOVA, Bayes Factor, and an Ordinal Pattern Analysis) in various data environments using a simulation study. The simulation generated 20000 unique datasets which varied sample size (*N*s of 10, 30, 100, 500, 1000), and effect sizes (*d*s of 0.10, 0.20, 0.05, 0.80). Through this simulation, we find that changing the threshold at which *p*-values are considered significant has little to no effect on conclusions. Further, we find that evaluating multiple estimates as evidence of an effect can allow for a more robust and nuanced report of findings. These findings suggest the need to redefine evidentiary value and reporting practices.},

  abstract = {Typing is a ubiquitous daily action for many individuals; yet, research on how these actions have changed our perception of language is limited. The QWERTY effect is an increase in valence ratings for words typed more with the right hand on a traditional keyboard (Jasmin \& Casasanto, 2012). Although this finding is intuitively appealing given both right handed dominance and the smaller number of letters typed with the right hand, extension and replication of the right side advantage is warranted. The present paper reexamined the QWERTY effect within the embodied cognition framework (Barsalou, 1999) and found that the right side advantage is replicable to new valence stimuli, as well as experimental manipulation. Further, when examining expertise, right side advantage interacted with typing speed and typability (i.e., alternating hand keypresses or finger switches) portraying that both skill and our procedural actions play a role in judgment of valence on words.},

  doi = {10/gdrbxc},
  abstract = {Psychologists wrestle with how to best handle multiple comparisons, while maintaining a balance between false positives and false negatives. Undercorrection, such as ignoring the presence of multiple comparisons altogether, is known to yield an unacceptably high rate of false positives. Overcorrection, such as treating all tests as independent when they are not, results in overly conservative evaluations of statistical significance. This tutorial demonstrates \$M\_\{eff\}\$ correction, a method for adjusting statistical significance thresholds for multiple comparisons, without the assumption of independence of tests. This method, in which the effective number of tests (\$M\_\{eff\}\$) is estimated from the correlations among the variables being tested, was developed and validated in the field of genetics, but is based on statistical concepts (eigenvalues) that are very familiar to psychologists. \$M\_\{eff\}\$ correction can be applied in psychological research to balance the necessity of correction for multiple comparisons with the concerns that arise from complex, correlated tests.},

  abstract = {Emotional expression has been shown to be benficial for promoting both positive psychological and physical health outcomes. Unfortunately, inhibiting emotions can lead to impairments in physical and psychological health. James Pennebaker showed that expressive writing is an effective form of emotional expression, and he and others have used expressive writing as an experimental manipulation to gauge its effectiveness in treating a wide variety of health-related and psychological outcomes. While many studies have been conducted that examine the effectiveness of expressive writing across such outcomes, a considerable amount of these studies tend to neglect necessary considerations such as power and meaningfulness of respective effect sizes. Four previous meta-analyses have been conducted that examine expressive writing's affect on psychological outcomes, however, these studies focus on the experimental versus control group effect size. Thus, our meta-analysis sought to examine the effectiveness of an expressive writing intervention on only the experimental conditions in studies measuring posttraumatic growth, posttraumatic stress, and quality of life using random effects models. Results indicated a small overall effect size for posttraumatic stress and negligible to small effect sizes for posttraumatic growth and quality of life. Implications for future research design and interpretation of published research are discussed.},

We evaluated the implementation of one innovation designed to mitigate this bias, ‘Registered Reports’, where study protocols are peer-reviewed and granted in-principle acceptance (IPA) for publication before the study has been conducted. As of February 2018, 91 journals had adopted Registered Reports and 91 Final Reports had been published. Psychology journals are the principal adopters, but expansion has begun into medicine, social science, and other fields. Among 29 journals that responded to a survey, 334 protocols had been submitted to them, 87 had been granted IPA and 32 Final Reports had been published or were in press as of July 2017. We encountered several sub-optimal implementation practices, including non-availability of IPA protocols, and diverse approaches to protocol registration in the absence of a single central registry. Registered Reports should be iteratively evaluated and improved to ensure maximal benefits.},
