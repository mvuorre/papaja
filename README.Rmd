[![Project Status: WIP - Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#wip) [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/crsh/papaja.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/crsh/papaja)

`papaja` is an R package in the making including an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) template that can be used with (or without) [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) to produce documents which conform to the American Psychological Association (APA) manuscript guidelines (6th Edition). The package uses the LaTeX document class [apa6](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/apa6) and a .docx-reference file, so you can create PDF documents, or Word documents if you have to. Moreover, `papaja` supplies R-functions that facilitate reporting results of your analyses in accordance with APA guidelines.

If you are looking for an in-depth introduction to `papaja`, check out the current draft of the [manual](https://crsh.github.io/papaja_man/).

**`papaja` is in active development and should be considered alpha. If you experience any problems, ask a question on Stack Overflow [using the `papaja` tag](https://t.co/Z3auyUrbTa) or [open an issue](https://github.com/crsh/papaja/issues) on Github.**
  

## Examples

Take a look at the [R Markdown-file](https://github.com/crsh/papaja/blob/master/inst/example/example.Rmd) of the example manuscript in the folder `example` and the resulting [PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crsh/papaja/master/inst/example/example.pdf).
The example document also contains some basic instructions.
For an in-depth introduction to `papaja`, check out the current draft of the [manual](https://crsh.github.io/papaja_man/).

## Installation

To use `papaja` you need either an up-to-date version of [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) or [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).
If you want to create PDF- in addition to DOCX-documents you additionally need
a [TeX](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) distribution.
If you have no use for TeX beyond rendering R Markdown documents, I recommend you use [TinyTex](https://yihui.name/tinytex/).
TinyTex can be installed from within R as follows.

```{r eval = FALSE}
if(!"tinytex" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) install.packages("tinytex")

tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

Otherwise consider [MikTeX](http://miktex.org/) for Windows, [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) for Mac, or [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) for Linux.
Please refer to the [`papaja` manual](https://crsh.github.io/papaja_man/introduction.html#getting-started) for detailed installation instructions.

`papaja` is not yet available on CRAN but you can install it from this repository:

```{r install_papapja, eval = FALSE}
# Install devtools package if necessary
if(!"devtools" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) install.packages("devtools")

# Install the stable development verions from GitHub
devtools::install_github("crsh/papaja")

# Install the latest development snapshot from GitHub
devtools::install_github("crsh/papaja@devel")
```


## How to use papaja
Once `papaja` is installed, you can select the APA template when creating a new Markdown file through the RStudio menus.

![APA template selection](inst/images/template_selection.png)

If you want to add citations specify your BibTeX-file in the YAML front matter of the document (`bibliography: my.bib`) and you can start citing. If necessary, have a look at R Markdown's [overview of the citation syntax](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html). You may also be interested in [citr](https://github.com/crsh/citr), an R Studio addin to swiftly insert Markdown citations.

### Helper functions to report analyses
The functions `apa_print()` and `apa_table()` facilitate reporting results of your analyses. Take a look at the [R Markdown-file](https://github.com/crsh/papaja/blob/master/inst/example/example.Rmd) of the example manuscript in the folder `example` and the resulting [PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crsh/papaja/master/inst/example/example.pdf).

Drop a supported analysis result, such as an `htest`- or `lm`-object, into `apa_print()` and receive a list of possible character strings that you can use to report the results of your analysis.

```{r echo = FALSE}
library("papaja")
```

```{r}
my_lm <- lm(Sepal.Width ~ Sepal.Length + Petal.Width + Petal.Length, data = iris)
apa_lm <- apa_print(my_lm)
```

One element of this list is `apa_lm$table` that, in the case of an `lm`-object, will contain a complete regression table. Pass `apa_lm$table` to `apa_table()` to turn it into a proper table in your PDF or Word document.

```{r eval = FALSE}
apa_table(apa_lm$table, caption = "Iris regression table.")
```

<!-- GitHub markdown doesn't support MathJax -->

Table. *Iris regression table.*

| Predictor     | *b*   | 95% CI          | *t(146)*   | *p*       |
|:--------------|------:|:---------------:|-----------:|----------:|
| Intercept     | 1.04  |  [0.51, 1.58]   | 3.85       | &lt; .001 |
| Sepal Length  | 0.61  |  [0.48, 0.73]   | 9.77       | &lt; .001 |
| Petal Width   | 0.56  |  [0.32, 0.80]   | 4.55       | &lt; .001 |
| Petal Length  | -0.59 |  [-0.71, -0.46] | -9.43      | &lt; .001 |

`papaja` currently provides methods for the following object classes:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
print_classes <- gsub("apa_print\\.", "", as.character(utils::methods("apa_print")))
print_classes <- print_classes[!grepl(",", print_classes)]
print_classes <- c(print_classes, rep(NA,  (4 - length(print_classes) %% 4) * (length(print_classes) %% 4 > 0)))
print_classes <- matrix(print_classes, ncol = 4)
colnames(print_classes) <- apply(print_classes, 2, function(x) {
  first_letters <- tolower(substr(x, 1, 1))
  first_letters <- c(first_letters[1], tail(first_letters, 1))
  first_letters[is.na(first_letters)] <- "z"
  col_names <- if(first_letters[1] == first_letters[2]) first_letters[1] else paste(first_letters, collapse = "-")
  toupper(col_names)
})
print_classes[is.na(print_classes)] <- ""
print_classes[grepl("lsm|emm|glht|ref\\.grid|BayesFactor", print_classes)] <- paste0(print_classes[grepl("lsm|emm|glht|ref\\.grid|BayesFactor", print_classes)], "<sup>*</sup>")

knitr::kable(print_classes)
```

\* Not fully tested, don't trust blindly!


### Plot functions

Be sure to also check out `apa_barplot()`, `apa_lineplot()`, and `apa_beeplot()` (or the general function `apa_factorial_plot()`) if you work with factorial designs:

```{r}
apa_factorial_plot(
  data = npk
  , id = "block"
  , dv = "yield"
  , factors = c("N", "P", "K")
  , ylim = c(0, 80)
  , level = .34
  , las = 1
  , ylab = "Yield"
  , plot = c("swarms", "lines", "error_bars", "points")
)
```

If you prefer creating your plots with `ggplot2` try `theme_apa()`.


### Using papaja without RStudio
Don't use RStudio? No problem. Use the `rmarkdown::render` function to create articles:

~~~{r}
# Create new R Markdown file
rmarkdown::draft(
  "mymanuscript.Rmd"
  , "apa6"
  , package = "papaja"
  , create_dir = FALSE
  , edit = FALSE
)

# Render manuscript
rmarkdown::render("mymanuscript.Rmd")
~~~


### Using papaja with CodeOcean

Seth Green has kindly prepared a [minimal `papaja` example capsule](https://codeocean.com/capsule/8183533/).
If you want to use `papaja` in your next CodeOcean project you can use this capsule as a starting point.

## Contribute
Like `papaja` and want to contribute? Take a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/crsh/papaja/issues) if you need inspiration. Other than that, there are many output objects from analysis methods that we would like `apa_print()` to support. Any new S3/S4-methods for this function are always appreciated (e.g., `factanal`, `fa`, `lavaan`, `lmer`, or `glmer`).


## Papers written with papaja

Please cite `papaja` if you use it (`citation('papaja')` will provide the reference). Below are some peer-reviewed publications that used `papaja`. If you have published a paper that was written with `papaja`, you can add the reference to the [public Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2202906/papaja) yourself or send it to me.

```{r include = FALSE}
papaja_bib <- RefManageR::ReadZotero(group = "2202906", .params = list())

for(i in 1:length(papaja_bib)) {
  papaja_bib[[i]]$note <- gsub("^\\d+\\s*", "", papaja_bib[[i]]$note)
}

RefManageR::WriteBib(papaja_bib, "inst/papaja_manuscripts.bib")
```
